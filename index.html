                <p>This league is a dynasty league that started it all. At a $100 buy-in, teams play in divisions with
                    division winners getting paid, and runner ups also making the playoffs. The league concludes in Week
                    18 with an All-Pro week where a virtual team is made up of players for across the three divisions
                    for an epic Head-Head-Head competition for the final payout!</p>
