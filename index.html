                    <h3>Main League - Legends of the Gridiron</h3>
                    <p>This league is a dynasty league that started it all. At a $100 buy-in, teams play in divisions
                        with
                        division winners getting paid, and runner ups also making the playoffs. The league concludes in
                        Week
                        18 with an All-Pro week where a virtual team is made up of players for across the three
                        divisions
                        for an epic Head-Head-Head competition for the final payout!</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>The Other League (Best Ball)</h3>
                    <p>With many of the same teams, this league has a smaller buy-in ($25). Teams draft 25 players and
                        compete head-to-head and against the median score. The top 6 teams make the playoffs, with
                        payouts
                        to the top 3 teams ($150/$100/$50).</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h3>The Other Best Ball League</h3>
                    <p>Similar to the above league but with different participants. The top 6 teams make the playoffs,
                        and
                        the top three are paid out.</p>
                </div>
            </li>

                <a href="BestBall3.html"><img src="static/img/BestBall3_thumbnail.png" alt="Best Ball 3 Thumbnail
                        class="thumbnail"></a>
                <div>
                    <h3>Best Ball 3</h3>
                    <p>Similar to the other two best ball leagues but with different participants.  The twist here is that there is no Superflex and we play 2 TE.  Also their is Scoring
                        to take advantage of the new NFL kick off rules, so points are afforded to return yards.  Also benches are smaller, only 10 players. 
                        The top 6 teams make the playoffs, and the top three are paid out.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Quick Draft 1</h3>
                    <p>This league features smaller teams and faster drafts. All 8 participants make the playoffs, with
                        payouts to the top 2 teams ($125/$75).</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Quick Draft 2</h3>
                    <p>In this league, no team can have more than one player per NFL team. The playoffs start in Week 12
                        with a 2-week matchup per round. The top 2 teams are paid ($125/$75).</p>
