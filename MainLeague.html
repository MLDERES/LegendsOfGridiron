        <h2>Playoff System</h2>
        <p>During the season each team will play the other teams at least once (division mates play each other twice).  Also each week, every team plays against the 
            median score in the league.  The top two players from each division (by record) make the playoffs.</p>
        <p>The other 6 teams fall to the consolation bracket where they will play to reset the divisons the following year.
            Each of the top 3 teams in the consolation bracket will draft their league mates in a linear draft at the conclusion of the season.</p>
        <h3>All-Pro Week</h3>
        The last week of the NFL season (Week 18) we'll have a special Head-Head-Head all-star mode where the three divisions
        will build teams to play against each other.
        <p>Teams must consist of at least 2 skills players from each division team and will fill a standard roster.
            The winning division will split a $200 cash prize between all the teams in the division.
        </p>
        <h2>Payouts</h2>
        <p>There are several payouts at the end of the season.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Division champs (3) at the end of regular season: $200 each</li>
            <li>Following the playoffs
                <ul>
