            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This league is a dynasty league that started it all. At a $100 buy-in, teams play in divisions with
                division
                winners getting paid, and runner ups also making the playoffs. The league concludes in Week 18 with an
                All-Pro week where a virtual team is made up of players for across the three divisions for an epic
                Head-Head-Head competition for the final payout!</p>

            <h2>Playoff System</h2>
            <p>During the season each team will play the other teams at least once (division mates play each other
                twice).
                Also each week, every team plays against the median score in the league. The top two players from each
                division (by record) make the playoffs.</p>
            <p>The other 6 teams fall to the consolation bracket where they will play to reset the divisions the
                following
                year. Each of the top 3 teams in the consolation bracket will draft their league mates in a linear draft
                at
                the conclusion of the season.</p>
            <h2>Payouts</h2>
            <p>There are several payouts at the end of the season:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Division champs (3) at the end of regular season: $100 each</li>
                <li>Following the playoffs:
                    <ul>
                        <li>1st Place overall: $400</li>
                        <li>2nd Place overall: $250</li>
                        <li>3rd Place overall: $100</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Pro-Bowl winning division $200 (to be split amongst all teams in winning division)</li>

        </section>

        <section id="rookiedrafts" class="content-section">
            <h2>Rookie Draft</h2>
            <p>A three-round rookie drafts will take place each year after the conclusion of the NFL draft.</p>
            <p>Rookie draft order (linear, not a snake draft) is set using the reverse order of "Max Points For"
                throughout the regular season.
                Keep in mind this might be different than how teams finish in the playoffs.</p>

        <section id="special-rules">
            <h2>Special Rules</h2>
            <p>Our league has the following special rules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Trade Deadline: Week 10</li>
                <li>Waiver Wire: Rolling waivers based on standings</li>
                <li>Roster Limits: 1 QB, 2 RBs, 3 WRs, 1 TE, 2 FLEX, 1 SuperFlex (QB/TE/WR/RB), 15 bench spots</li>
                <li>Injured Reserve: 2 IR spots</li>
                <li>Taxi: 2 rookie taxi spots</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Taxi Protocol</h3>
            <p>You may place any Y1 rookies into the taxi spot. They can remain there until they have 2 years of NFL
                experience, at which point they must be moved out of the taxi on the roster or dropped.</p>
            <p>You can move players into the taxi up until the first week of the season. After this, once you remove a
                player, they cannot go back into the taxi.</p>
            <h3>Pro-Bowl</h3>
            <p>The last week of the NFL season (Week 18) we'll have a special Head-Head-Head all-star mode where the
                three
                divisions will build teams to play against each other.</p>
            <p>Teams must consist of at least 2 skills players from each division team and will fill a standard roster.
                The
                winning division will split a $200 cash prize between all the teams in the division.</p>
